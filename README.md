This is a WIP build framework for the awesome Linux from Scratch project. The
goal is to provide an automated way to build the initial system and get a
working bootable disk. The host target is currently Ubuntu 16.04 LTS as a known
good host.

A further goal will be to use the built Python framework to also manage packages
for BLFS too.

Building

* Mount drive
* make sure LFS and LFS_TGT are defined in the env
* link LFS to /tools
* add /tools/bin to the path
* fix /bin/sh symlink "sudo update-alternatives --install /bin/sh sh /bin/bash 100"
* check versions with supplied script
* install build-essential, gawk, texinfo, bison
* install python packages pyyaml, docopt
* "./bin lfsbuild bootstrap-build-system"
