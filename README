This is a WIP build framework for the awesome Linux from Scratch project. The
goal is to provide an automated way to build the initial system and get a
working bootable disk. The host target is currently Ubuntu 16.04 LTS as a known
good host.

A further goal will be to use the built Python framework to also manage packages
for BLFS too.

Building

* Mount drive
* make sure LFS and LFS_TGT are defined in the env
* link LFS to /tools
* add /tools/bin to the path
* check versions with supplied script
* install build-essential, gawk, texinfo, bison
