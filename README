This is a WIP build framework for the awesome Linux from Scratch project. The 
goal is to provide an automated way to build the initial system and get a 
working bootable disk. The host target is currently Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

A further goal will be to use the built Python framework to also manage packages
for BLFS too.
